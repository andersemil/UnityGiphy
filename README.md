> This package contains a simple implementation of the Giphy API required to display random Gif images in Unity as MP4 videos.</br>
> This package does not provide a means to display a gif directly but does provide urls to gif version of the images.</br>
> Instead this package uses the mp4 links provided by giphy's api to display the gifs as movies.</br>

## Usage

To get started you must create an app and get an API key on the https://developers.giphy.com/ website.<br />
Create your GiphyConfig asset by using the Create->Gameframe->Giphy->Config in the project tab's Create menu.<br />
Once you have created your GiphyConfig asset you should add your API key to it that you got from the Giphy developer website.<br />
You can use your config asset and the demo scene included in this package to get started.

This library provides a GiphyRawImageController component that can be used with RawImage and VideoPlayer
for displaying random giphy images in your UI but example API code is also shown below.

```C#
//You can make basic queries to Giphy using the API provide in the GiphyQuery class.
//As of this writing only Random and Search endpoints are supported.
//For more info on the query results please see the following documentation
// https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint

//Example code that loads a random image and plays it as a video
public async void ShowRandomImage()
{
  //Get a single random result
  var randomResult = await GiphyQuery.Random(apiKey,searchKeywords);

  //Display the random image result using Unity's video player
  videoPlayer.source = VideoSource.url;
  videoPlayer.url = randomResult.result.data.images.original_mp4.mp4;
  videoPlayer.Play();
}
```
